                    hese are the terms and conditions (“Terms”) that govern the relationship between you, our customer (referred to as “you” in these terms) and OneStopDocumentation. If you are a consumer within the meaning of any local law e.g. Consumer Protection Act (“Consumer”) then additional rights may be available to you and will be specified in this document. If you are not a Consumer, you confirm that you have authority to bind any business on whose behalf you seek to purchase services. These Terms shall include certain terms specified on the relevant OneStopDocumentation website for your country (“Website”) located at cibtvisas.ca, including the OneStopDocumentationPrivacy Policy which when taken together are exclusive in relation to OneStopDocumentation services. Other general terms and conditions do not apply and do not form part of the contract between us, even if we do not explicitly reject them. The Terms are subject to change without prior notice, except that the Terms in force at the time you place or modify an order will govern the order in question. For the avoidance of doubt, mere viewing of (in contrast to ordering services from) the Website is subject to the Terms Of Website Use and not these Terms.
                    <br> <br>
                      The primary services provided by OneStopDocumentation are to help you in obtaining travel visas and other travel documentation. We describe documents and forms you generally need to provide to achieve these aims and then submit these documents and forms duly completed by you, to the authorities or appropriate bodies. For the avoidance of doubt, if we provide services to you, you are our customer and these Terms apply. If we refer you to any other service provider, you take responsibility for reviewing any services provided and that service provider’s terms and conditions will apply for their services. We do not accept any liability for third party services and these Terms will not apply to those services.
                      <br> <br>
                      Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. After you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. If your order appears to be correct, we will notify you that we have accepted your order and begun work on it. This acceptance email is titled “Your Order Has Been Received”. The contract between us will only be formed when we send you this acceptance email.
                      <br> <br>
                      These Terms apply to any offer and any agreement between you andOneStopDocumentation and to the provision of any service provided to you by or on behalf of OneStopDocumentation in respect of but not limited to the processing of visas, passports and/or documents for you or on your behalf. Some Terms may refer to an issuing authority, which is the body being an embassy, consulate or other agency that issue or supply the documents requested by you.
                      <br> <br>
                      If OneStopDocumentation provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of these Terms will govern your relationship with OneStopDocumentation. If there is any inconsistency between the English language version of these Terms and the translation, the English language version shall take precedence.
                      <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="my-2"> Procedure </h3>
                    <p class="my-2">
                    OneStopDocumentation will endeavour to provide you with accurate information and to ensure that you obtain the visa for your trip for the date required in a timely manner. Nevertheless, you should remember that all requirements to obtain the visa (documentation, fees, time frames, etc) are calculated based on general criteria and can vary according to information provided by you such as current or previous nationality, residence, gender, age, profession, recent travel, religion etc. You should also remember that the issuing authority may change general country requirements without notice or require additional specific information from you.  OneStopDocumentation will try to inform you as soon as practicable of such changes. This rule also holds for all other documents issued by  OneStopDocumentation
                  </p>
                    <h3 class="my-5">Submission of documentation</h3>
                    <p class="my-3">
                      You can consult the list of requisites to be met in order to process your visa on our website. To ensure that you know where your documents are at all times, you will be sent an e-mail confirming the receipt of your documents when it reaches our offices.
                      <br> <br>
                      OneStopDocumentationwill only process the documents indicated in your request; it assumes no responsibility for other documents required for your trip that have not been requested or which relate to stops on your trip.
                      <br> <br>
                      By submitting one or more requests to process one or more visas to OneStopDocumentation, you accept these Terms. Once your request(s) has/have been made toOneStopDocumentation, OneStopDocumentation shall send to the e-mail address provided by you an email with the specific conditions of the visa requested (type of visa, destination, time frame, etc.). On receipt of your documentation your requests will be validated and OneStopDocumentation shall commence the procedures to obtain the visa(s). If offered, phone orders will be accepted on the day of placement and mail orders will be accepted: (a) if provided with an email address, when we email you with a ‘Confirmation Order Received’; or otherwise (b) on the first business day after receipt of the completed forms. OneStopDocumentation reserves the right to refuse in its total discretion to handle any application at any time and no reason need be given.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="my-3">Obtaining the visa</h3>
                    <p class="my-2">
                      When OneStopDocumentation returns your passport and documents to you, it is important that you confirm that all of the documents you need for your travel have been obtained, that visas for each country you intend to visit are valid for the dates of arrival and departure from the country/region of your visit and for the purpose and nature of your visit (tourism, business, study, etc.). You must notify OneStopDocumentation immediately by email if you identify any discrepancy in your documentation.
                      <br> <br>
                      The issue of a visa depends exclusively on the issuing authority and immigration officials in each country have the final decision to admit entry into the country or region, even when all of the stipulated requirements have been met. OneStopDocumentation does not guarantee that the issuing authority will issue the visa in a timely manner and within the specified time frame; therefore, OneStopDocumentation fees will be collected for the completion of procedures required for this issue. Non-refundable fares or reservations must not be purchased until all visas have been obtained.
                      </p>

                      <p class="my-2">
                        The issuing authority will make the final determination as to the type of visa or passport, how quickly it will be issued and for what duration it will be issued. Prior to approval, the issuing authority may ask for additional documentation. The issuing authority may reject any visa, passport or other travel document application for any reason and may not provide a reason to OneStopDocumnentation for the rejection. OneStopDocumnentationdoes not issue visas or passports and cannot make any guarantee or assurances that any issuing authority will issue any document nor can OneStopDocumnentations guarantee the time required for an issuing authority to grant or reject an application. Issuing authorities may choose to grant a different type of travel document than that which the applicant has requested which may impact the purpose, validity or number of entries. As a result, non-refundable tickets or reservations should not be purchased until all the required travel documents for your trip have been secured. OneStopDocumnentation, in addition to the issuing authorities, reserve the right to prioritize processing according to the travel dates you provide. OneStopDocumnentation service fees are assessed for taking reasonable actions to foster the issuance of a requested travel documents.

                        <br> <br>

                        OneStopDocumnentation provides visa and passport information in good faith on the express understanding that the said information is the interpretation of any or all information provided by respective embassies, consulates or passport offices at any or all times and CIBTvisas shall not accept responsibility or liability whatsoever for any errors and/or omissions in the information.
                        <br> <br>
                        OneStopDocumnentation will endeavor, wherever possible, to process the client's visa, passport and/or document based on the instructions given and application forms submitted, although it is the client's express responsibility to ensure that the validity of the said visa/passport/document obtained includes and covers the periods of time in which the client plans to enter and leave the country or countries that the client is visiting and for the number of entries to that country and is valid for the purpose intended.
                        <br> <br>
                        When OneStopDocumnentation returns your passport and documents, it is your responsibility to verify that all the visas you require for your trip have been obtained, that the visas for each country you intend to visit are valid for the entry and exit dates of your visit, that your personal details are reflected accurately, and that your passport is valid for at least six months beyond the completion of your trip. Please note that even when a visa is issued, a traveller may be denied entry since in each country the local immigration officials make the final entry decision. OneStopDocumnentation recommends all travellers secure a visa prior to departure and do not attempt to obtain one “on arrival”.
